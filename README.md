This Repository portrays my tiny projects/practices, which are very useful if you are starting out your frontend web-development journey, this little projects will help you a lot and will bring something new to the table.

1. Cards Design - I have used HTML and CSS to made a card design which you see frequently in websites, with some animation and hover effect

2. Glow Design - It is also a card sort of design with little bit of twist, because here I added some glowing effect on mouse hover and also used some basic animation for smoothness.

3. Responsive Gallery - Made a responsive Gallery using HTML and CSS, used grid and flex properties, not used media-query property.

4. Search Bar - A Unique Search Bar using HTML and CSS, with little bit of transition property for smoothness.

5. Random Colour Generator - A very common JS project, which helps us to learn dom better. Added a start and stop button. Clicking on "start" it starts generating random colour untill the user clicks "stop"
